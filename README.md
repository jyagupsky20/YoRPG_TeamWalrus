TeamWalrus (Humans: Daniel Jung, Joshua Yagupsky, Ethan Lam; Ducks: Ralph, Quacker, Carl)

The subclasses of Protagonist are:
1. Human: The typical protagonist with average statistics. Its special ability is the strong attack that was originally defined for the standard protagonist.
2. Wizard: The wizard is a bit stronger than the human, but is less defensive. It can perform strong spells at the cost of its health.
3. Elf: The elf is a sort of middle of the road, having the lowest strength and a middle tier defense. However, it more than makes up for it with its healing ability, which temporarily makes its attacks weaker while healing 5 HP.

The subclasses of Monster are:
1. George Clooney: Just your average monster with middle-of-the-road stats.
2. Annoyed Tiger: A very powerful monster that has poor defense.
3. Evil Armadillo: A weak monster that has strong defensive capabilities.

Version 1 was our version before we added subclasses. Version 2 added in the Protagonist subclasses, but they were largely undeveloped. Version 3 finalized the Protagonist types. Version 4 featured our Monster subclasses.
