Classes can extend other classes. This allows the child class to inherit all of the methods and attributes of the parent.
You can then add functionality in the child class or modify functionality from the parent class via overloading.

super is a keyword that refers to the parent class of a class you are working with. You can run super.anyMethod()
to run super's version of anyMethod, even non-static ones. Writing super() invokes the parent class's constructor function.
